# Automate-Classroom
This device is developed using esp8366 module in Arduino IDE software.
We used Ultra-Sonic sensor to detect the motion.
The COUNT of the students in the classroom is displayed on Thingspeak website which can be monitor through online from anywhere.
If nobody in the classroom, the Power Supply to the classroom will be Turn-Off automatically.
So that we can save the unnecessary wastage of Electricity
