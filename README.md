# Automate-Classroom
This device is developed using ESP8266 in Arduino IDE software and two Ultra-Sonic(Inside,Outside) sensors are used to detect the motion.

ESP8266 has a built-in WIFI module which is used to send the COUNT of the students in the classroom to the Thingspeak website ehere it can be monitor through online from anywhere.

If nobody in the classroom, the Power Supply to the classroom will be Turn-Off automatically, So that we can save the unnecessary wastage of Electricity.
